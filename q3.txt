An endpoint that ensures that a post is only added one time is called an "idempotent" endpoint.
An idempotent endpoint is an HTTP endpoint that guarantees that any number of identical requests will have the same effect as a single request. It means that the endpoint will not change the state of the resource more than once, even if the request is sent multiple times. This is achieved by not allowing multiple identical requests to change the state of the resource and returning the same result. It ensures that the resource remains in a consistent state.
For example, an idempotent endpoint for adding a post would only create a new post once, even if the user clicks multiple times and sends multiple requests to the endpoint. The subsequent requests would return the same post without creating new duplicate posts.
You can achieve this by adding some sort of versioning to the post or using some sort of locking mechanism to prevent multiple requests from modifying the resource at the same time.
